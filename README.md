# Diabetes Prediction App

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This web application predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features using a machine learning model. The model has been trained using data on various health metrics.

## Features

- Predicts the probability of diabetes based on user inputs.
- Simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
- Integration with a trained machine learning model.

## Demo

Include a screenshot or GIF of your app here to give users a preview of how it looks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.

Enter values for the required health metrics (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure).

Click on the "Predict" button.

The app will display the predicted probability of diabetes.
