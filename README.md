Diabetes Prediction App
This web application predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features using a machine learning model. The model has been trained using data on various health metrics.

Features
Predicts the probability of diabetes based on user inputs.
Simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
Integration with a trained machine learning model.
Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Pip (Python package installer)

Required Python packages (install using pip install -r requirements.txt):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
cd diabetes-prediction-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the App
To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command launches a local web server and opens the app in your default web browser.

Usage
Once the app is running, you will see the input fields.
Enter values for the required health metrics (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure).
Click on the "Predict" button.
The app will display the predicted probability of diabetes.
